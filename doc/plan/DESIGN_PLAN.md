## Overview

In our project, we hope to create an application which allows users
to create strategy games in the following domain:
* the board is 2d and “checkerboard-like” and convex
* There are no more than 2 players, which can be AI or human
* Rules are deterministic
* Sequential & not “real-time” turns
* Perfect information

We intend two create two functionally separate application, a builder and a game engine. The builder
will be responsible for allowing users to create game configurations that specify the board, pieces,
rules, and conditions of a game. The engine is responsible for loading these configurations and 
allowing users to play the games.

## Design Details

### Builder

[Builder Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/R75cgz0MIS9m1zZj4H3HDi/Figma-Wireframing-Kit-(Community)?node-id=1009%3A489)

The builder is responsible for allowing users to create custom game configurations. The basic 
game elements that the user will be allowed to create are to the board, the pieces, the rules, and
the winning conditions of a game. 

The builder will provide a collection of tabs, each of which corresponds to game elements that the
user wishes to create. For instance, there will be a "piece" tab that allows the user to define the 
properties of the pieces in the game, such as their color, movement patterns, and image. There will
likewise be a tab for rules, the board, and winning conditions.

Each of these tabs is responsible for displaying an intuitive UI for creating game elements, which 
are stored in the back end as game elements. When the view wishes to display the properties of 
existing game elements, it will receive a record that describes the piece (instead of passing 
pieces directly to the view). Game elements are open to extension, meaning any aspect of the game
that we want the user to be able to customize can be a game element. Potential extensions include 
turn lengths, timers, etc.

Once the user has described the game elements, they will be prompted to place pieces on the board,
defining the starting position of the pieces. This starting configuration will be stored in the
model, updated whenever a new piece is added.

Finally, when the game configuration is complete, the entire configuration will be converted to JSON
format using a pre-defined schema. This schema is universal between the engine and builder, so 
configurations created by the builder can be run by the engine.

Adding the extension of Artificial Agents is simple with this design, as it involves creating a new
tab and a new game element. Once the properties for the artificial agents are defined, they can be
added to the JSON schema easily.

The view and model communicate with each other through a controller. This controller enables two-way
communication, which is needed to pass parameters from the view to the model in the case of creating
new game elements as well as passing parameters of already created game elements to the view for 
display purposes. This design also allows a strict distinction between the view and model, with the 
view simply obtaining records that represent game elements instead of the elements themselves (which
are only needed by the model for JSON serialization).


### Engine

## Design Considerations

### Communication Between Builder and Engine
We discussed at length on how the Builder and Engine should communicate with each other. In the end,
we settled on the solution of letting the JSON schema be the only form of "communication" between 
the two. We wanted to make sure the builder and engine were as decoupled as possible to make 
development easier and reduce the complexity of the APIs that we created. Using a well-defined JSON 
schema for both the builder and engine means that there doesn't need to be an extra translation ste
between the two modules.

### Shared Objects Between Builder and Engine
While the Builder and Engine both have objects representing Rules, Pieces, and Boards, we opted to 
not share objects between the two. We made this decision to reduce the coupling between the two 
modules and also because the implementations of the pieces in the engine and builders will be quite
different (the engine has actual functionality, the builder just stores properties). While sharing
objects would potentially ease the process of serializing the objects into JSON data, the dependency
structure it would cause would not be worth it.
